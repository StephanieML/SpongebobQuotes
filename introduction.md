I have no idea how to use markdown so I'm just copying and pasting some intro stuff here. Maybe someone can edit the markdown :)
Let's do this!

Beginnings

“I have a brutal piece of advice for you: be lucky.”
		-Neel Smith

I loved Greek class at Holy Cross.

That’s probably not a surprise; I’m contributing to this volume.

By the time I made it to Intermediate Greek II, our 18-student cohort had self-selected itself down to about eight students. 
We eight diehards settled in for some delightful nine a.m. ‘banqueting’ with Achilles et al. in Iliad IX, my printout littered 
with the usual vocab words, questions, scanning for meter. Professor Neel Smith blustered into the room about a minute early, 
and with characteristic hair flip rigged up his famous Macbook (it never left his side), fiddling with the projector as we 
sleepily bantered. Expecting the usual Unicode Iliad to flash onto the screen, we were puzzled by the wildly incomprehensible—
if gorgeous—image of some highly complex manuscript page Professor Smith loaded.

“Anyone want to take a stab at reading this?”

Silence. Awkward shifts in chairs. Lots of raised eyebrows exchanged.

“I mean...what is it?” Someone finally spoke up. Professor Smith beamed, and launched into the lecture that would turn me 
into a full-blown, card-carrying Homerist.

Be lucky.

If there’s one thing I know about my time working on the Homer Multitext Project, it is that I was at the right place at the 
right time. Digital photography of the Venetus A, Venetus B, and Marciana 841 (Allen’s u4) manuscripts had been acquired in 
2007, just three years before my sophomore year at the College of the Holy Cross; the college had recently landed a Mellon 
Foundation grant to fund summer research in the humanities; and I took Professor Smith’s above-mentioned Intermediate Greek II 
seminar in the heat of this critical crossroads. So here I am, feeling grateful, humbled, and old as dirt in recalling my 
entry into this project, especially poignant now as teams all over the world—in Massachusetts; South Carolina; Texas; 
Washington; Leiden; Leipzig, and the list grows each year— close in on the first complete pass of a digital edition of the 
Venetus A.

A lot has happened since that day in Intermediate Greek II, and we’d like to tell you about it: we, the generations of 
student-scholars whose lives have been enormously, incomprehensibly impacted by a man—Professor D. Neel Smith— manuscripts, 
and a tiny, windowless lab on Fenwick 4.
